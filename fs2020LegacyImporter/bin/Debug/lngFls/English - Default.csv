Keep all aircraft in single folder with proper structure (should contain Gauges and SimObjects) so program will be able to find newerly added resources.\nExtracted files will be stored in the ""{0}"" directory."
panel_convert_gauges_notice,,"Panels conversion script will parse "".panel.cfg"" file(s), then load all required XMLs and convert their data into modern format - HTML/JS/CSS.

If conversion failed and you can't see any/some gauges at all in the cockpit - these option will not help, it may happen because these gauges contained in DLL/GAU files and can't be extracted, or converted script(s) has an error inside that probably will be fixed in next program update."
